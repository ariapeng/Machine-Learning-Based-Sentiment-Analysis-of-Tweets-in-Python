# Machine-Learning-based-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Tweets
  
This project  
  1) Performed statistical analysis of 8,100 tweets that tagged #PuertoRico over the period of hurricane Maria in 2017  
  2) Compared Lexicon- and RandomForest- based measurement of sentiment in the tweets  
  
The JupyterNotebook file `python.ipynb` is a well-described file, so just follow the steps.  
  
**NOTE:** 
  + Here I provide the clean tweets dataset.  
  + I zipped the `tweets_ps2.jsonl` to make it small enough for upload, otherwise Github won't let me do it.  
  + So you need to unzip it first.   
  + Also, gather all files in the same folder for file reading.  
  
Thank you.
